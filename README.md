# Identifying-vulnerabilities-for-a-small-business




<h2>Description</h2>
In this activity, I conducted a vulnerability assessment for a small business, aiming to evaluate the risks associated with its information systems and devise a remediation plan. The purpose section highlighted the importance of safeguarding sensitive data and protecting against potential threats and attacks. A completed risk assessment was provided in the risk assessment section, outlining identified vulnerabilities and their potential impact. The approach section explained the reasoning behind each identified risk, emphasizing potential consequences for business operations and data security. Finally, the remediation section summarized proposed actions to address vulnerabilities and strengthen security defenses. Through this comprehensive assessment, actionable recommendations were offered to enhance the organization's security posture and resilience against cyber threats.
